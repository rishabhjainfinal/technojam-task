# task_14
There are two games including dice that you can play. In the main game, you move two dice together and get the dollar sum comparable to the result of the rolls. In the subsequent game, you move one dice and acquire the dollar sum identical to the square of that value. Which game has the higher anticipated worth and why?


| Dice-no. | Probability G1 (1/36) | Game-1 (main) worth | Probability G2 (1/6) | Game-2 (subsequent) worth | Profit difference|Results | Worth difference % | Discription |
| -------- |---| ----- |-------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---|
|    1     | 0.0277 | (2-7)   | 0.166 | 1  | -6 |G1  | -85% | every possible G1 value is greater G2 better possible from G2 is 6/6 = 1 |
|    2     | 0.0277 | (3-8)   | 0.166 | 4  | -4 |G1  | -50% | possible G1 value is greater G2 except when (2,1) better possible from G2 is 5/6 |
|    3     | 0.0277 | (4-9)   | 0.166 | 9  |  0 |G2  | 0% | G2 is better except (3,6) better possible from G2 is 0/6 |
|    4     | 0.0277 | (5-10)  | 0.166 | 16 |  6 |G2  | 37.5% | every possible G2 value is greater G1 ,G1 better possible from G2 is 0/6 |
|    5     | 0.0277 | (6-11)  | 0.166 | 25 | 14 |G2  | 56% | every possible G2 value is greater G1 ,G1 better possible from G2 is 0/6 |
|    6     | 0.0277 | (7-12)  | 0.166 | 36 | 24 |G2  | 66% | every possible G2 value is greater G1 ,G1 better possible from G2 is 0/6 |


### Which game has the higher anticipated worth and why?
*Game-2* has the higher anticipated worth from the above table we get that the probability of geting the better number pair in game-1 = 1/36 (in which only 11/36 is profitable then G2),game-2 = 1/6 (from which 4/6 have high worth) and the profit ratio is better for Game-2
